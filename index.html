            <p class="card-text">I am currently in a program called Year Up that trains young adults to have the skills to work in top corporate tech companies. Year Up helps you gain the soft skills and technical skills to be successful in your career.

              I have strong technical skills related to computer hardware and software as well. I have basic knowledge about coding. I have skills in audio recording, mixing, and editing. I have great communication skills that helps me communicate material easily and ensure that message delivered as intended.
              
              Taking tasks and constantly learning new things is something that I challenge myself at. I am pursuing my career by taking classes to transfer to a 4-year university and graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. I also am passionate in entrepreneurship and investing. I am teaching myself by listening to podcasts and practicing it through simulations. </p>
